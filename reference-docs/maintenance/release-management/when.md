# When to perform a release

A sprint has 4 weeks, the release workflow happens in the last two weeks:

- Week 3
  - Monday 10am
    - Open the upstream releases: it marks the beginning of the integration week (testing is done by the developers), only fix commits are allowed on release branches.
    - Create the release notes in [the release notes repository](https://github.com/upfrontIO/livingdocs-release-notes)
  - Friday 10am
    - Close the upstream releases: it marks the end of the integration week, no more commits are allowed on the release branches.
- Week 4
  - Monday 10am
    - Deliver the upstream releases to the client and the corresponding release notes.
