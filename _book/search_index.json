This is a headless CMS approach. You can get started immediately by just creating an account on livingdocs.io\nRefer to our API documentation for more information on the available endpoints.\nLivingdocs on-premises\nIf you use Livingdocs as an on-premises software you will have access to the (private) boilerplates projects and/or an .npmrc file with access to our core repositories (Note: this requires at least signing an evaluation contract, if you haven't done so already contact us at contact@livingdocs.io).\nTo get a local setup refer to our setup guide and the README's linked in the boilerplate projects.\nTo get a devops environment, refer to our devops section.\n"},"walkthroughs/getting-started-with-local-development.html":{"url":"walkthroughs/getting-started-with-local-development.html","title":"Setting up Livingdocs locally","keywords":"","body":"Getting started with livingdocs\nBoth the server and the editor ship with a default configuration, that works out of the box with the Dockerfiles we provide.\nInstall Docker\nInstall the docker engine to use our\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/\nNode setup\nnvm\nNode Version Manager is a simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions\nhttps://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script\njq\njq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor\nhttps://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/\nInstall node and npm\nIf the project requires a specific node or npm version, it is stated in the package.json.

These files are checked in to source control and therefore shared with everyone working with the project.\nFor local overrides you can use secrets/{environment}.coffee in the server and user_specific/{environment}.coffee in the editor. These files are not checked in to source control and therefore specific to your local installation.\nSensitive configuration\nAccording to the 12 factor app methodology, sensitive data and secrets should not be checked in to source control.\nAlways reference sensitive configs with environment variables, for example:\ndb: {\n  username: myuser,\n  password: process.env.db__password\n}\n\nSetting the environment\nThe environment derives from the environment variable ENVIRONMENT.\nFor example to set the environment to local, run\nexport ENVIRONMENT=\n\nYou can set this variable to any value that you have a config for in your environments folder.\nProceed with the instructions in the projects README\n"},"concepts/glossary.html":{"url":"concepts/glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nLivingdoc & Designs\n\nLivingdoc\nA representation of content.

You can group and order the appearance of\n  // your components here.\n  groups: [\n    {\n      label: 'Headers',\n      components: ['title']\n    }, {\n      label: 'Text',\n      components: ['paragraph']\n    }\n  ],\n\n  // The defaults paragraph component defines which component is\n  // inserted if a user hits ENTER.\n  // The default image component defines which image component is\n  // inserted if a user drags and drops an image on a document\n  defaultComponents: {\n    paragraph: 'paragraph',\n    image: 'image'\n  },\n\n  // Image ratios allow you to control the aspect ratios\n  // of uploaded images.\n  imageRatios: {\n    \"16:9\": {\n      label: \"16:9 Cinemascope\",\n      ratio: \"16/9\"\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nHow to define components\nThe atom of a design is the component. Each component is a file in the filesystem with the ending .html.\nIt includes a HTML template and configuration options. In your template you can use attributes to tell Livingdocs what\nelements can be edited or changed. Basically you create rules for the Livingdocs editor for what users will be allowed to change.\nFollowing you see a basic paragraph definition. It consists of a configuration part inside a  tag and an HTML part.\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"myParagraph\",\n  \"label\": \"My very first paragraph\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n  Placeholder text\n\n\nIn the configuration (inside the  tag) the name and label of the component is defined that is shown to the user in the user interface.\nThe HTML part defines a paragraph with a doc-editable attribute. The attribute has a value of 'text'. This means that the text assigned to the paragraph by the user (inline editing) will be accessible through the property 'text'. The content inside the paragraph will be used as the placeholder text and disappear as soon as the user starts typing.\nGo ahead and create a file called myParagraph.html under src/components/Text and paste the above content.\nAdding your component to the design\nOnce you have a component definition you will want to add your new component to your design. For this we will\nneed to move to our config.json file in the timeline project. Find the section groups within this file.\nHere you can add your newly created myParagraph component. (NOTE: Use the name, not the label).\nAdd it to any of the existing groups or create a new one. Now run a build and you will get a dist folder with a\nnew design definition that contains your new component.\nUsing the preview\nIn order to preview your components in the livingdocs-design-timeline project you can add it to the file src/index.html.\nIn the script section of this file you will see the creation of a Livingdoc using the JSON data model.\nDon't worry about the details of this data yet. Simply navigate to the end of the content array and add the following markup:\n{\n  \"component\": \"myParagraph\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"text\": \"This is placeholder text for the preview.\"\n  }\n}\n\nYou just added a myParagraph component to the preview Livingdoc and assigned some sample text to the text template of this component.\nNow start the development server on your command line and you should get a browser window with your preview document, fully working with inline editing.\n(NOTE: this is not the Livingdocs editor only the Livingdocs framework is loaded).\nA more complex example\nThis is an example of a cover component with a background image and a title on top of that image.\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"cover\"\n  \"label\": \"Cover\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Title\n    \n  \n\n\nThis component definition has a doc-image attribute on a  tag. This will give the user the opportunity to upload an image that will the be used as the background-image of that  tag. Just like the doc-editable, the doc-image also has an attribute value that gives the background image property of this component a name so it can be accessed.\nAvailable attributes in the component HTML\nA Livingdocs component definition consists of HTML that has added attributes that define the possible content or behaviour of the component.\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndoc-editable\nThe content of this tag is editable text by the user.\n\n\ndoc-image\nThe user can select and image that is set as a src attribute on  tags and as background-image style on other tags.\n\n\ndoc-optional\nCan be used only with doc-editable and prevents rendering of the tag to the published document if the editable content is empty.\n\n\ndoc-container\nThis tag can contain other components.\n\n\ndoc-html\nThe content of this tag is freeform HTML. This can be used to embed tweets or IFrames.\n\n\ndoc-link\nThe href attribute of this tag can be set to a link by the user.\n\n\ndoc-include\nInside of this tag, the server will render an edge-side include of the given type\n\n\ndoc-style\nAllows a user to set the style attribute on a DOM node\n\n\n\nBut I want my own design\nSure enough you don't want to keep working with the livingdocs-design-timeline forever. We highly advise you though to use the setup defined there as it makes working with Livingdocs designs a lot easier. Just create a Github fork of the livingdocs-design-timeline project (or copy it by hand), name it anything you like and start replacing the CSS and HTML with your own.\n"},"reference-docs/common-designs/component_config.html":{"url":"reference-docs/common-designs/component_config.html","title":"Livingdocs components","keywords":"","body":"Component configuration\nEvery component has a script block at the top of the file that can take different kinds of configurations. Following we will describe them one by one in logical blocks.\nAdministrative configuration\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"p\"\n  \"label\": \"Paragraph\"\n}\n\n\n\n  foo\n\n\n\n\nname\nThe handle of the component. This is how the component is referenced in either code or the config.json file where it is assigned to a group.\n\nlabel\nThe label that is used in the editor's sidebar. This is the human label. See example above.\n\n\n\nProperties\nProperties allow you to reference style properties (CSS classes or styles) that are defined in the config.json. They will be available to the user in the Livingdocs editor when the respective component is selected.\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Aside\",\n  \"properties\": [\"featured\"]\n}\n\n\n\n  \n    Heading\n  \n  \n    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n  \n\n\nContainer\nallowedParents: Allows you to define what components are allowed as parents of this component. The allowed parents must contain at least one doc-container directive. Normally, this config comes in tandem with the allowedChildren configuration on the doc-container directive (see further down in the doc-container section).\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"bullet-list-item\",\n  \"label\": \"Bullet List Item\",\n  \"allowedParents\": [\"bullet-list\"]\n}\n\n\nList item\n\nDirectives\nDirectives are the editable parts of a component and come in different flavors, e.g. doc-editable, doc-image, etc. Every directive can take different options. Following, we describe the different options for different kinds of directives.\ndoc-editable\nplainText: Ensures that a text can not contain any HTML tags (decodes HTML).\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"foo\",\n  \"directives\": {\n    \"title\": {\n      \"plainText\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n  \n    Titel\n  \n\n\nexcludeFromTextCount: Tells the editor to exclude the directive\nfrom text counter. By default every doc-editable will be counted.\nExample, only count text directive:\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"foo\",\n  \"directives\": {\n    \"title\": {\n      \"excludeFromTextCount\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n  Titel\n  Text\n\n\ndoc-link\nprefill: allows to define a metadata fetching service to prefill the content of other directives from the result of fetching metadata from the respective link. Currently only iframely is supported as a metadata service. What this does in a nutshell is parsing the head section of a linked HTML page (the content of doc-link) for meta tags.\nThis configuration comes in handy when doing external teasers, i.e. a teaser to an arbitrary webpage that the user can enter in a link.\nExample:\n\n  {\n    \"label\": \"Web Teaser\",\n    \"directives\": {\n      \"link\": {\n        \"prefill\": {\n          \"title\": {\n            \"key\": \"title\",\n            \"provider\": \"iframely\"\n          },\n          \"site\": {\n            \"key\": \"site\",\n            \"provider\": \"iframely\"\n          },\n          \"headline\": {\n            \"key\": \"author\",\n            \"provider\": \"iframely\"\n          },\n          \"image\": {\n            \"key\": \"image\",\n            \"provider\": \"iframely\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"image\": {\n        \"imageRatios\": [\"16:9\"],\n        \"allowOriginalRatio\": false\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Headline Source\n      \n      Title\n    \n  \n\n\nReading example: The doc-editable directive headline will be filled through the metadata service iframely and the content comes from the metadata key author.\ndoc-image\nratios: allows you to define pre-defined image ratios for an image. The cropping mask in the Livingdocs editor will show those ratios when cropping the image of the respective component.\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Normal Image\",\n  \"directives\": {\n    \"image\": {\n      \"imageRatios\": [\"16:9\", \"1:1\", \"4:3\", \"3:4\"],\n      \"allowOriginalRatio\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n  \n  Add image caption\n\n\n\nallowOriginalRatio: true or false. If true will show the original ratio of the image in the crop selection box as well. See example above.\ndoc-container\ndefaultComponent: allows you to overwrite the default components inside a container. Probably the most important one is the paragraph default component which defines what happens upon pressing the Enter key.\ndefaultContent: array. Defines a set of components that are available by default in the container. ATTENTION: This applies only when the component is dragged in by a human. If a component is created by a machine (e.g. import or data migration) no default content is set.\nCommon use case: The two configurations can be used to define the container of a repeatable such as a bullet point list. An editor drags in a component with a container with the according configuration that already has one item of the repeatable by default (defaultContent) and upon pressing Enter the user can repeat it (defaultComponents -> paragraph).\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Bullet List\",\n  \"name\": \"bullet-list\",\n  \"directives\": {\n    \"list\": {\n      \"defaultComponents\": {\n        \"paragraph\": \"bullet-list-item\"\n      },\n      \"defaultContent\": [\n        {\n          \"component\": \"bullet-list-item\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe list item for the example above looks like this:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"bullet-list-item\",\n  \"label\": \"Bullet List Item\",\n  \"allowedParents\": [\"bullet-list\"]\n}\n\n\nList item\n\n\nallowedChildren: array. Allows you to define which components are allowed within a certain container. Great if you need to restrict what users can do in a design.\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Media Gallery\",\n  \"directives\": {\n    \"slides\": {\n      \"allowedChildren\": [\"image-slide\", \"media-slide\", \"quote-slide\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n  Mediengalerie\n  \n\n\ndoc-style\nproperties: Array of style properties that are set when the user enters content. E.g. in the example below a user could set a hex-code for a color that is then set to style=\"background-color:user-value\".\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"article-header\",\n  \"label\": \"Artikelkopf\",\n  \"allowedParents\": [\"root\"],\n  \"directives\": {\n    \"background\": {\n      \"properties\": [\n        \"css-background-color\": {\n          \"type\": \"style\",\n          \"label\": \"Background Color\",\n          \"cssProperty\": \"background-color\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"title\": {\n      \"plainText\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Artikel Headline\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum.\n    \n  \n\n\ndoc-include\n(also see the following techtalk)\nservice: defines the service type to use which corresponds to the name of an existing server-side plugin. doc-include services are freely configurable and are implemented as plugins in customizing projects. The concept is similar to edge side includes.\nExample:\n\n  {\n    \"name\": \"top-row\",\n    \"label\": \"Top Row\",\n    \"directives\": {\n      \"latest-news\": {\n        \"service\": \"list\",\n        \"defaultParams\": {\n          \"count\": 5,\n          \"layout\": \"news\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"top-teasers\": {\n        \"service\": \"list\",\n        \"config\": {\n          \"minCount\": 3,\n          \"maxCount\": 3\n        },\n        \"defaultParams\": {\n          \"layout\": \"teaserRowHigh\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Title\n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\ndefaultParams: set of default parameters that are sent to the server-side plugin. Usually you will implement an editor plugin that allows users to change the default parameters in the editor.\nconfig: configuration parameters that are sent to the editor plugin to customize the user interface.\n"},"reference-docs/common-designs/design_config.html":{"url":"reference-docs/common-designs/design_config.html","title":"Design configuration","keywords":"","body":"Livingdocs design basics\nconfig.json\nThe config.json defines the design configuration. You can specifiy through the design configuration what options are available and how components behave when editing in the Livingdocs editor.\nBasic Information:\n\"name\": \"boilerplate\",\n\"label\": \"Boilerplate Design\",\n\"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n\"author\": \"upfront.io\"\n\nComponents\nInside of the folder src/components you can define HTML components that can be used in documents that use your design. These components will be automatically inserted into dist/design.json when you run a build.\nFor every component you can create a new file. Here is an example for a paragraph:\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Paragraph\"\n}\n\n\n\n  Lorem Ipsum...\n\n\nInside of the  you can define configurations for the components. The component itself is built with normal HTML and Livingdocs specific attributes indicate to Livingdocs what content the user can change and edit. The attribute doc-editable will turn the paragraph into an editable element.\nPreview Component\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"hero\",\n  \"label\": \"Hero Teaser\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n  Hello, world!\n  \n    This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling extra attention to featured content or information.\n  \n  \n    Learn more\n  \n\n\nDefault Components\nThe defaultComponents configuration tells the editor which components should be used by default for some basic interactions like Pressing Enter at the end of a paragraph. Since Livingdocs is completely configurable you can for example define what your standard text paragraph looks like.\n\"defaultComponents\": {\n  \"paragraph\": \"p\", // The default component to insert when pressing Enter\n  \"image\": \"image\"  // The component to insert when dragging an image into the document.\n}\n\nComponent Properties\nThe settings in componentProperties will add configuration options to your components. Technically a componentProperty will just add a css class to the top level element of a component if it is selected by the user. You can use these properties in one of your components as shown further below.\n\"componentProperties\": {\n\n  // Dropcap that will add the css class 'drop-cap' to a component if selected\n  \"dropcap\": {\n    \"label\": \"Drop Capital\",\n    \"type\": \"option\",\n    \"value\": \"drop-cap\"\n  },\n\n  // Position property that lets the user choose to add either the css class 'position-left' or 'position-right' to a component.\n  \"position\": {\n    \"label\": \"Position\",\n    \"type\": \"select\",\n    \"options\": [\n      {\n        \"caption\": \"Default\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"caption\": \"Left\",\n        \"value\": \"position-left\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"caption\": \"Right\",\n        \"value\": \"position-right\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nThis is an example configuration of a paragraph component that uses the dropcap componentProperty. This will automatically add a checkbox to the user inteface so the user can select if they want to have a dropcap at the beginning of their paragraph.\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Paragraph\",\n  \"properties\": [\"dropcap\"]\n}\n\n\n\n  Lorem Ipsum...\n\n\nImage Aspect Ratios\nNamed aspect ratios can be added to a design that can be reused in the components. It is possible to restrict images to certain aspect ratios to for example ensure that an image is always a landscape image of 16:9.\n\"imageRatios\": {\n  \"16:9\": {\n    \"label\": \"16:9\",\n    \"ratio\": \"16x9\"\n  },\n  \"1:1\": {\n    \"label\": \"1:1\",\n    \"ratio\": \"1x1\"\n  }\n}\n\nIn a component the aspect ratios can be defined per image directive. In the following example the user can crop the image freely and the aspect ratios 16:9 and 1:1 are available in the UI to conveniently crop to these ratios.\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Image\",\n  \"directives\": {\n    \"image\": {\n      \"imageRatios\": [\"16:9\", \"1:1\"],\n      \"allowOriginalRatio\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nLayouts\nLayouts define different type of documents. When creating a document in the\neditor, a user can choose which layout he wants to use.\nA layout defines a list of components and a default content that will be present\nafter the document has been created. Also a wrapper can be defined that will\nbe used.\n\"layouts\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"regular\",\n    \"caption\": \"Article\",\n    \"wrapper\": \"\",\n    \"defaultContent\": [\n      { \"component\": \"head\" },\n      { \"component\": \"normal\" },\n      { \"component\": \"p\" }\n    ],\n    \"groups\": [...] // Overwrites the default groups config.\n  }\n]\n\nGroups\nFor the User interface you can group your components. This is done via the groups configuration. These are purely instructions for the user interface how to display a grouped list of components to the user.\n\"groups\": [\n  {\n    \"label\": \"Headers\",\n    \"components\": [\"hero\", \"head\", \"title\"]\n  }, {\n    \"label\": \"Text\",\n    \"components\": [\"subtitle\", \"p\", \"quote\", \"aside\"]\n  }, {\n    \"label\": \"Images\",\n    \"components\": [\"image\", \"peephole\"]\n  }\n],\n\nMetadata\nThis section allows you to configure the livingdocs metadata extractor for the document's content. For example you might want to extract the content of a title component automatically to a metadata field 'title' in your CMS.\nThe configuration allows you for each requested metadata field to define which . combinations should be used for extraction and in what order.\nThere are two types of content that can be extracted: text and images. You can define which one you want in the parameter 'type'.\nmetadata: [\n  {\n    identifier: 'title',\n    type: 'text',\n    matches: ['hero.title', 'head.title', 'title.title'],\n    isEditable: true\n  }, {\n    identifier: 'teaserImage',\n    type: 'image',\n    matches: ['hero.image', 'image.image'],\n    imageRatios: ['16:9'],\n    isEditable: true\n  }\n]\n\nThe example above will take the metadata field 'title' preferably from the directive title in the component hero otherwise from the component head or if none of these are available from the component title.\nPrefilled Components\nThis configuration option lets you define components that should be prefilled upon document creation. E.g., you might want to prefill the author field of a newly created document to the name of the current user.\nThere are two types of prefill modes: 'string' and 'computed'. String will just use the string inside the 'value' field to do the prefilling. Computed expects a respective handler method inside the livingdocs-editor so you can only use this type if you have control over the livingdocs-editor.\nprefilledComponents: {\n  \"header\": {\n    \"author\": {\n      \"value\": \"author\",\n      \"type\": \"computed\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"image\": {\n    \"caption\": {\n      \"value\": \"&nbsp;(all copyright by me)\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe example above will generate the content of header.author from the handler method \"author\" inside the livingdocs-editor and the content of image.caption will always be prefilled with \"all copyright by me\".\nPrefilling is just an initial value. You can always overwrite the content in the editor.\n"},"reference-docs/common-designs/list_example.html":{"url":"reference-docs/common-designs/list_example.html","title":"Bullet List","keywords":"","body":"Example of a simple bullet list\nA list is basically a set of 2 components: a container component that holds the list items and a repeatable component that is inserted whenever a user presses enter in the container. You can basically make everything a repeatable.

Instead of database columns you define directives on a component, e.g. an editable title (doc-editable='title'). The component's \"database\" now has a \"column\" title.\nJust as with a database you need to write data migrations if you make structural changes. This is necessary to adapt all existing documents to the new structure.\nThe next chapter will describe which kinds of design changes require you to write a migration script and which ones can be handled with a simple version bump. The section after that will show you the structure of a migration script. After that we look at the grunt task to help you run migrations and last but not least we'll present some examples of migration scripts.\nMigrations from design changes\nLivingdocs designs have a version number in the config.json file that follows the semver pattern. You should create a major version whenever a design change requires you to write a data migration. Livingdocs is very strict with un-migrated documents: when you try to open a document that has a different structure than the design you're using, it will fail with an error.\nThe following changes require a data migration:\n\nremoving a directive from a component\nrenaming a directive in a component\nchanging the type of a directive (e.g. from doc-editable to doc-image)\n\nThe following changes do not require a data migration, but can be done with a simple version bump. Note though that depending on the case you still might want to write a migration, it's just not mandatory, i.e. Livingdocs won't crash if you don't.\n\nHTML or CSS changes that don't affect the structure\nchanges in the design's wrapper or any of the layout's wrappers\nchanges in the assets of a design\nadding a new directive to a component (will be empty)\nadding a new layout\nmoving a directive from one HTML tag to another in the same component\nremoving or adding a doc-optional directive (doc-optional is never breaking)\nremoving or changing a component property on a component (will be silently ignored)\nchanges in the component set of a layout\nchanges in the component set of a group\nchanging the default component\nchanges in the image ratios\nchanges in the default content\nchanges in the pre-filled components (will not be re-calculated for old documents)\nchanges in the metadata field extractor configuration\n\nIt is important to note that the data migrations only affect the Livingdocs data model and not the published HTML. When you need to update your published HTML, for example after you changed some HTML markup, you need to write a custom handler for this in the boilerplate app that renders the last publication of a document and notifies your delivery layer of the change.\nStructure of a migration script\nThe previous section explained data migrations as a consequence of a design change. But data migrations really are a general-purpose tool that can be used to alter your existing documents. A different and common example is the need to add a new metadata field to all of your documents and initialize the value in some way.\nThe Livingdocs migration framework gives you a hook method to implement and calls this method with every document in your project. The hook method looks like this:\nexports.migrate = ({serializedLivingdoc, metadata}, callback) => {\n  // do your stuff here\n\n  // overwrite the JSON data model and the metadata in the response\n  callback(null, {serializedLivingdoc, metadata})\n}\n\nFor every document you will get the serialized Livingdoc data model (JSON) and the metadata associated with that document. You can then alter the JSON and metadata in your migration method and pass it to the callback which will automatically apply your changes to the document.\nIn order to create a migration script, simply add a file to the folder app/data-migrations. It might make sense to have some sort of increasing identifier in the filename to visualize history. In the file create a method exports.migrate as described above and implement your desired migration steps.\nTo run your migration script, use the data-migration grunt task which is explained in the next section.\nThe data-migration grunt task\nLivingdocs provides a grunt task to help you running and managing data migrations. If you type grunt data-migration on the command line of your boilerplate app, you get the following menu:\nSelect an action to execute, press CTRL+C to cancel:\n? Action (Use arrow keys)\n❯ Creates and prepares a migration\n  Accepts a migration\n  Lists all migrations\n  Get a migration description\n  Cancels a migration\n  Show migration report\n\nEach migration is a 2-step process:\n\nExecuting the migration\nAccepting the migration\n\nThe option \"Creates and prepares a migration\" allows you to start a new migration. You can either choose:\n\na simple version bump which bumps the design version in all your documents to a new design version without affecting the structure of the documents\nor select a migration script from the filesystem to tell the Livingdocs how to migrate your documents (the next section will show some examples for such scripts), to select, type in a file path relative to your root directory, e.g. app/data-migrations/your_migration.js\n\nOnce you created a migration, it will run for all your documents. In the case of a migration script it will also generate a report for you that lists possible errors that were encountered with your script. (For a version bump there is no report, since errors are impossible). You can view this report by selecting the option \"Show migration report\".\nIf after reviewing the report you don't want the migration to be applied, just select the option \"Cancels a migration\" and the changes will be discarded.\nIf you want the migration to be applied, select \"Accepts a migration\" which will update all necessary database records and alters your documents.\nThe option \"Lists all migrations\" lists all migrations you prepared or accepted in your project.\nThe option \"Get a migration description\" allows you to review migration reports of prior migrations.\nThe following diagram visualizes the most important states and actions:\n\nExamples\nThe boilerplate app implements three example migrations that you can take as a starting point for your own migrations. (Don't run the example migrations, they are using a sample design which is not configured).\n\nMigration script after removing a directive from a component\n\nMigration script after renaming a directive on a component\n\nMigration script to initialize a new metadata field\n\n\n"},"walkthroughs/add_customizations.html":{"url":"walkthroughs/add_customizations.html","title":"Register customizations","keywords":"","body":"Adding Customizations\nIf you use Livingdocs as on-premises software you can register plugins through a code API in both the editor and the server. Your projects will use a package.json file to install the core editor and server respectively as npm packages in a specific version.\nThe boilerplate projects are small customizing project setups that illustrate this.\nThis document gives an overview of how to register custom features without going into detail on how to write any of them.\nServer\n(Refer to the boilerplate server to see real examples of this.)\nA custom server feature can contain any code you like. Common examples are bridges to third-party APIs or import features that import documents from some other source like an old legacy CMS.\nThis section only refers to coded customizations. Other behavior can be customized using the JSON configuration files.\nIn the server you will normally have an app/server.js file add new features. The content looks something like this:\nconst config = require('../conf')\n// require the core server that you installed via npm\nconst server = require('@livingdocs/server')\n\n// Create livingdocs server instance\nconst liServer = server(config)\n\n// register your custom features\nliServer.features.register('custom-webhook', require('./webhook'))\nliServer.features.register('custom-import', require('./import'))\n\nmodule.exports = liServer\n\nA custom feature is normally put in a separate folder under app and has an index.js file with the following structure.\nmodule.exports = function (feature, server) {\n\n  // get configuration options that you might have under this feature\n  const appConfig = server.config.get('featureName')\n\n  // Initialize feature\n  // require files from your feature. Use dependency injection and\n  // avoid state in required files.\n  const featureApi = require('./featureApi')\n\n  // Expose an api that other features can use\n  feature.registerApi(featureApi)\n\n  // Expose routes and controller functions if applicable (not all features need\n  // a REST API)\n  feature.registerResource({\n    controller: editingApiController,\n    routes: editingApiRoutes\n  })\n}\n\nIf you need to get your feature at some other point in your customizing project, you can do so with:\nconst featureApi = server.features.api('featureName')\nfeatureApi.doSomething()\n(you need the server instance for this)\nThe same also works if you need to access any of the core features from Livingdocs, which by convention all start with li-.\nEditor\nThe code customizations in the Livingdocs editor (user interface) are restricted to the following cases:\n\ncustom Angular factories or services (for use in other customizations)\ncustom Angular components for metadata fields\n.. or custom model classes for existing metadata fields\ncustom Angular components for doc-include sidebar user interfaces\ncustom Dashboard filters\ncustom Dahboard item (a single item in the articles dashboard)\ncustom Embed components (the core contains Iframes and Tweets)\ncustom Iframely metadata extractors\nlocale customizations\n\nIn addition to this some behavior can be customized using the JSON configuration.\nThe editor (like the server) usually has an app/editor.js file where code customizations are registered and that looks something like this:\n// entry point when using the webpack build of the editor\nconst liEditor = require('@livingdocs/editor')()\nconst editingApiModule = window.angular.module('li-editing-api')\n// the Angular editorModule -> can be used to register services and factories\nconst editorModule = window.angular.module('livingdocs-editor')\n\n// example of loading a custom angular module: ui-validate\n// require('angular-ui-validate')\n// editorModule.requires.push('ui.validate')\n\n// Just require a custom Angular factory using the editorApiModule\nrequire('./custom/scripts/factories/categories')(editingApiModule)\n\n// Register a custom filter for the dashboard\nconst layoutsFilter = require('./custom/filters/layouts_filter')\nliEditor.searchFilters.registerList('layouts', layoutsFilter)\n\n// Register a custom doc-include sidebar interface (Angular component)\nliEditor.includes.register('brightcove', {\n  template: require('../plugins/doc-includes/ld-brightcove-include/brightcove_include_template.html'),\n  controller: require('../plugins/doc-includes/ld-brightcove-include/brightcove_include_controller'),\n  bindings: {\n    directive: '=',\n    componentView: '=',\n    component: '='\n  }\n})\n\n// Register a custom metadata field model (business logic)\nliEditor.metadataServices\n  .register('categorySelection',\n    require('../plugins/metadata_services/category_selection_service'))\n\n// Example of custom embeds\n// embeds = require('@livingdocs/editor/app/scripts/modules/embeds/embeds')\n// Pinterest = require('./custom/scripts/modules/embeds/pinterest/pinterest')\n// Facebook = require('./custom/scripts/modules/embeds/facebook/facebook')\n// embeds.registerCustomEmbeds [\n//   Facebook,\n//   Pinterest\n// ]\n\nconst Iframely = require('@livingdocs/editor/app/scripts/modules/iframely')\nconst defaultExtractor = require('@livingdocs/editor/app/scripts/modules/iframely/default_metadata_extractor')\nIframely.initializeOembedMetadataExtractor(defaultExtractor)\n\n// Example of changing the date locale\n// moment = require('moment')\n// momentDe = require('moment/locale/de')\n// moment.locale('de')\n\nliEditor.mount()\n\n"},"reference-docs/editor-configuration/metadata.html":{"url":"reference-docs/editor-configuration/metadata.html","title":"Metadata","keywords":"","body":"Metadata on the Editor\nScope\nThis documentation assumes that you already setup the metadata field(s) on the server side.\nTo find out more about metadata on the server you can read the server documentation or study examples.\nIntroduction\nIn order to make metadata editable to the journalists you need to configure the editor.\nThe editor offers a UI library of re-usable elements (text fields, select boxes, etc.) for which customers can write their own business logic where necessary. You can also write your own custom UI elements by just requiring them in your project.\nScreen types\nAs you can see in the examples you nest your metadata screen configuration in an array under a key. The example defined the key article. This is the screen type for which you define a metadata screen. Currently, we support 2 screen types: articles and pages. In the long run we might take in different channels here too, but for now we don't have that requirement.\nAvailable UI elements\nThere are UI elements for:\n\ntext input (example above)\ncheckbox\ndatetime (date and time)\nslugs (URL escaped titles)\nselect boxes\nmultiselect boxes\nimage selection\nsection headers (not a form, only a title)\n\nThe following subchapters discuss them and show the available options.\nText Input\nname: 'nameOfYourMetadataTextField',\nform: 'li-meta-text-form',\nconfig: {\n  halfWidth: false, // optional, false by default\n  service: 'nameOfYourServicePlugin', // mandatory\n  label: 'foo', // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n  placeholder: 'bar', // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n  readOnly: false, // optional, false by default\n  maxLength: 200 // optional, integer, not used by default\n}\n\nYou need to make sure that your server-side metadata field is of type li-text otherwise you will get errors.\nThe halfWidth option will render the text input field over half of the screen width if set to true (otherwise over the full width). readOnly and maxLength let you customize the behavior of the text input.\nThe service option lets you customize the business logic of a metadata form field. Check the section \"registering a metadata service\" later on how to register a service.\nThe service plugin for a text input allows you to customize the logic for the following methods:\n{\n  // init the value of the text input\n  init (identifier) {},\n\n  // set the value\n  set (identifier, text) {}\n}\n\nThere is a sample implementation in plugins/metadata_services/default_text_service.coffee to help you get started.\nSelect Box\nname: 'nameOfYourMetadataSelectField',\nform: 'li-meta-select-form',\nconfig: {\n  service: 'nameOfYourServicePlugin', // mandatory\n  halfWidth: false, // optional, false by default\n  label: 'foo', // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n  placeholder: 'bar' // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n}\n\nYou need to make sure that your server-side metadata field is of type li-enum or a suitable format you defined yourself in a customized server, otherwise you will get errors.\nThe halfWidth option will render the text input field over half of the screen width if set to true (otherwise over the full width).\nThe service option lets you customize the business logic of a metadata form field. Check the section \"registering a metadata service\" later on how to register a service.\nThe service plugin for a select box allows you to customize the logic for the following methods:\n{\n  // asynchronous\n  // needs to call cb with cb(null, selectables) or cb(error)\n  // the selectables need to be in the format {name: 'name', value: 'value'}\n  getSelectables (callback) {},\n\n  // called when the select box is first rendered and needs to get an initial value\n  // you will probably use `metadata.get` to get the required value\n  initSelection (identifier) {},\n\n  // executed when a user select an item.\n  // the identifier is the name of your metadata field, the selection contains the name/value pair\n  // you will probably call `metadata.set` in here\n  select (identifier, selection) {},\n\n  // true if you want to define your own directive for the display of results in the select box\n  // false otherwise\n  hasCustomItem () {},\n\n  // the name of a directive that you want to use to render the items (lines) in the select box when\n  // it is opened. This is handy for example if you want to render them in a hierarchical view.\n  // make sure that you require the directive in your service so it is loaded.\n  getCustomItem () {}\n}\n\nThere is a sample implementation in plugins/metadata_services/default_select_service.coffee to help you get started.\nMultiselect Box\nname: 'nameOfYourMetadataMultiselectField',\nform: 'li-meta-multiselect-form',\nconfig: {\n  service: 'nameOfYourServicePlugin', // mandatory\n  halfWidth: false, // optional, false by default\n  label: 'foo', // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n  placeholder: 'bar' // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n}\n\nYou need to make sure that your server-side metadata field is of a suitable format you defined yourself in a customized server (there is no core data type for multiselects), otherwise you will get errors.\nThe halfWidth option will render the text input field over half of the screen width if set to true (otherwise over the full width).\nThe service option lets you customize the business logic of a metadata form field. Check the section \"registering a metadata service\" later on how to register a service.\nThe service plugin for a multiselect box allows you to customize the logic for the following methods:\n{\n  // asynchronous\n  // needs to call cb with cb(null, selectables) or cb(error)\n  // the selectables need to be in the format {name: 'name', value: 'value'}\n  getSelectables () {},\n\n  // called when the select box is first rendered and needs to get an initial value\n  // you will probably use `metadata.get` to get the required value\n  initSelection (identifier) {},\n\n  // executed when a user adds a selection to the multiselection.\n  // the identifier is the name of your metadata field, the selection contains the name/value pair\n  // you will probably call `metadata.set` in here\n  select (identifier, selection) {},\n\n  // executed when a user removes a selection of the multiselect.\n  // the identifier is the name of your metadata field\n  // you will probably call `metadata.set` in here\n  unselect (identifier) {}\n}\n\nThere is a sample implementation in plugins/metadata_services/default_multiselect_service.coffee to help you get started.\nImage Selection\nname: 'nameOfYourMetadataImageField',\nform: 'li-meta-image-form'\n\nThe image selection was taken over as is from the existing implementation and does not adhere to the general plugin architecture. We should fix this at some point in the future.\nFor now the content is defined through the method metadata.getEditableImages. Basically this takes the values defined in the design configuration for the images. So for example if you have the following design configuration excerpt:\n\"metadata\": [\n  {\n      \"identifier\": \"teaserImage\",\n      \"type\": \"image\",\n      \"matches\": [\"image.image\"],\n      \"isEditable\": true,\n      \"imageRatios\": [\"4:3\", \"16:9\"]\n  }\n]\n\nThis would fill the metadata screen with a section for the field \"teaserImage\" giving 2 selections, a \"4:3\" image and a \"16:9\" image. The data format for the image value is hardcoded at the moment and can not be customized. An example of a metadata image format can be found here: https://gist.github.com/gabrielhase/9d7b0ff518585da844c257591a810ecc\nThe current implementation is especially dangerous since the metadata section in a design config is not really metadata at all, its only a field extractor for metadata.\nAlso, the markup in the image form does not adhere to the plugin standard, so don't look here when doing your own plugin.\nCheckbox\nname: 'nameOfYourMetadataImageField',\nform: 'li-meta-checkbox-form',\nconfig: {\n  halfWidth: false, // optional, false by default\n  label: 'foo' // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n}\n\nYou need to make sure that your server-side metadata field is of type li-boolean or a suitable custom format, otherwise you will get errors.\nThe halfWidth option will render the text input field over half of the screen width if set to true (otherwise over the full width).\nDatetime\nname: 'nameOfYourMetadataImageField',\nform: 'li-meta-datetime-form',\nconfig: {\n  service: 'nameOfYourServicePlugin', // mandatory\n  halfWidth: false, // optional, false by default\n  label: 'foo', // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n}\n\nYou need to make sure that your server-side metadata field is of type li-datetime or a suitable custom format, otherwise you will get errors.\nThe halfWidth option will render the text input field over half of the screen width if set to true (otherwise over the full width).\nThe service option lets you customize the business logic of a metadata form field. Check the section \"registering a metadata service\" later on how to register a service.\nThe service plugin for a datetime allows you to customize the logic for the following methods:\n{\n  // set the date, possibly applying formatting options\n  setDate (identifier, value) {},\n\n  // get the date, possibly applying formatting options\n  getDate (identifier) {},\n\n  // this lets you define what dates a user can select in the UI. Handy if you want for example\n  // to disallow past dates.\n  isValidDate (date) {}\n}\n\nThere is a sample implementation in plugins/metadata_services/default_date_service.coffee to help you get started.\nSlug\nname: 'nameOfYourMetadataImageField',\nform: 'li-meta-slug-form',\nconfig: {\n  service: 'nameOfYourServicePlugin', // mandatory\n  halfWidth: false, // optional, false by default\n  label: 'foo', // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n  placeholder: 'bar', // optional, takes camelized name otherwise\n  canReset: false // optional, false by default\n}\n\nYou need to make sure that your server-side metadata field is of type li-text or a suitable custom format, otherwise you will get errors.\nThe halfWidth option will render the text input field over half of the screen width if set to true (otherwise over the full width).\nThe canReset option if set to true renders a reset button next to the slug input that resets the input to its initial value.\nThe service option lets you customize the business logic of a metadata form field. Check the section \"registering a metadata service\" later on how to register a service.\nThe service plugin for a slug allows you to customize the logic for the following methods:\n{\n  // define the logic for the initial value of a slug\n  // For example: existing value or normalized metadata title\n  initSlug (identifier) {},\n\n  // gives you the unnormalized slug input (user input) and lets you define your custom\n  // normalization logic (depending on what you want to allow in a URL)\n  setSlug (identifier, slug) {},\n\n  // only important if `canReset` is set to true\n  // defines to what value the field will be reset\n  resetSlug (identifier) {}\n}\n\nThere is a sample implementation in plugins/metadata_services/default_slug_service.coffee to help you get started.\nSection Headers\nSince the whole publish panel form is generated you might want to set your own section headers (titles) in some instances. To do so, just place a markup as the following at the respective place in your config:\narticles: [{\n  name: 'someFieldBeforeTitle',\n  form: 'li-meta-text-form'\n}, {\n  type: 'sectionHeader',\n  header: 'MyAwesomeTitle'\n}, {\n  name: 'someFieldUnderTheHeader',\n  form: 'li-meta-text-form'\n}]\n\nThis would render the title MyAwesomeTitle in between the 2 text fields.\nSection headers are always clear-fixed and go over the full width.\nRegistering a metadata service\nSome of the forms require you to provide a service that implements the business logic behind those fields. In order to register a service you will need to add it to core/bootstrap/index.coffee. To add a fictional metadata service foobar you would add the following line:\neditor.metadataServices.register('foobar', require('path/to/foobar'))\n\nThe file foobar.coffee defines the metadata service and gives you a metadata instance as well as the angular injector. It should always have the following format:\nmodule.exports = function ({metadata, $injector}) {\n  // your implementation goes here\n}\n\nIn the future we want to write our own injector for this to control more tightly what can be injected and what is private in the core.\nCreating a new metadata form element (core)\nCurrently, new UI elements can only be created in the core. As a core developer you might need to create one though at some point. Here are some things to look out for.\nAll UI elements should be implemented as Angular components and get at least the 2 bindings name and type. name is the name of the metadata field and type the type of screen for which it is instantiated, i.e. article or page.\nA new UI element has to be required in ld_metadata_view.coffee.\nThe template should have a surrounding li element of this form:\n\n\n\nThe ng-class is optional, only use it when you want to expose the halfWidth option on your UI element.\n"},"reference-docs/editor-configuration/search-filters.html":{"url":"reference-docs/editor-configuration/search-filters.html","title":"Dashboard search filters","keywords":"","body":"Search Filters\nThe editor core API exposes functions to customize the search filters on the dashboard.\n\nAvailable config options\n\narticleList\nThis configures the dashboard that users see after logging in.\n\ninlineArticleList\nThis configures inline article search like the one used in the List screen.\n\npageList\nThis configures the pages screen.\n\ndocumentListList\nThis configures the List screen.\n\n\nProperties:\n\ndisplayFilters\nThe filters that are shown to the user.\n\ndefaultQueries\nThis setting determines the default filter.

A configuration for specialChars looks as follows.\napp: {\n  specialChars: [\n    {\n    'name': 'general',\n    'label': 'General',\n    'charList': [\n      {\n          'name': 'EN DASH',\n          'label': '–',\n          'caption': null,\n          'value': '–',\n          'description': 'Dash of 1 en length'\n        }, {\n          'name': 'VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF',\n          'label': '½',\n          'caption': null,\n          'value': '½',\n          'description': 'Fraction: one half'\n        }\n      }, {\n        'name': 'white_spaces',\n        'label': 'White Spaces',\n        'charList': [\n          {\n            'name': 'EN SPACE',\n            'label': '◅···▻',\n            'caption': 'en',\n            'value': ' ',\n            'description': 'EN Space'\n          }, {\n            'name': 'FOUR-PER-EM SPACE',\n            'label': '◅··▻',\n            'caption': '1/4',\n            'value': ' ',\n            'description': '1/4 EM Space'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nAdvanced Formatting Options\nIn addition to configuring what options the text toolbar gives to your users you can also configure to some extent the HTML markup that is inserted when a formatting option is selected. Currently, you can configure the markup for bold, italic and link. An example is below.\napp: {\n  editable: {\n    formatting: {\n      boldMarkup: {\n        type: 'tag',\n        name: 'strong',\n        attribs: {\n          'class': 'foo'\n        }\n      },\n      italicMarkup: {\n        type: 'tag',\n        name: 'em',\n        attribs: {\n          'class': 'bar'\n        }\n      },\n      linkMarkup: {\n        type: 'tag',\n        name: 'a',\n        attribs: {\n          'class': 'foo bar'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nA common use case for this is when you want to insert some CSS classes around your formatted text, as in the example above. You are not restricted to the class attribute however but can configure any HTML attribute you like.\nText Editing Behavior\nNewlines with Shift+Enter. Default: true\napp: {\n  editable: {\n    allowNewline: false\n  }\n}\n\nAllows the users to make a newline in a paragraph by pressing Shift+Enter. This will result in a  tag an might not always be wanted thus the ability to turn this off.\nEvents on Mouse selection. Default: false\napp: {\n  editable: {\n    mouseMoveSelectionChanges: true\n  }\n}\n\nBy default the editable selection event is only fired once the user releases the mouse over a selection. With this setting you can already get events when the user still holds the mouse while making a selection. This is only useful if you want to somehow support the user during the process of making a selection and it will fire lots of events so be cautious with this one.\nSpellcheck\nLivingdocs allows you to use the default browser spellcheck, a custom spellcheck server or no spellchecking at all.\nSpellchecking turned off:\napp: {\n  editable: {\n    browserSpellcheck: false\n  }\n},\nspellcheck: {\n  isEnabled: false\n}\n\nDefault browser spellchecking:\napp: {\n  editable: {\n    browserSpellcheck: true\n  }\n},\nspellcheck: {\n  isEnabled: false\n}\n\nCustom spellchecker (examples are NZZs vademecum or Duden):\napp: {\n  editable: {\n    browserSpellcheck: false\n  }\n},\nspellcheck: {\n  isEnabled: true,\n  'host': 'http://your-spellcheck-server.com'\n}\n\nCharacter Counter\nA character counter can be configured. The counter can be limited to only\ncount text within certain components.\ntextcount: {\n  isEnabled: true,\n  timeout: 200\n}\n\nIt is also possible to only count the text of selected components (if components is null or an empty array it will count the text of all components):\ntextcount: {\n  isEnabled: true,\n  timeout: 200,\n  components: [\n    'p',\n    'list-item',\n    'quote'\n  ]\n}\n\n"},"reference-docs/editor-configuration/image-cropping.html":{"url":"reference-docs/editor-configuration/image-cropping.html","title":"Configure image cropping","keywords":"","body":"Image cropping\nThe image cropping in Livingdocs is implemented as an open-source library available here.\nThe Livingdocs editor allows you to set certain configuration options to customize the behavior of the cropping interface.\nFor all configurable options in the library, see here\nExample Editor configuration\n{\n  editor: {\n    imageCrop: {\n      showSurroundingImage: 'always',\n      surroundingImageOpacity: 0.5,\n      zoomStep: 1.05,\n      maxArea: 0.5\n    }\n  }  \n}\n\nshowSurroundingImage\nPossible values: always, panning, never, Default: never\nIf set to always you will see the cropped out parts in opacity, if set to never you will not see the cropped out parts, if set to panning you will only see the cropped out parts in opacity when dragging.\nsurroundingImageOpacity\nPossible values: between 0 and 1, Default: 0.2\nDeduces the opacity with which the cropped out parts are shown (see above).\nzoomStep\nPossible values: between 1 and 2, Default: 1.25\nDeduces zoom steps when zooming into an image and out. 1.05 zooms in 5% with every step.\nmaxArea\nPossible values: null or between 0 and 1, Default: null\nIf set to null (or left out in the config) the full image will be shown and changing the horizontal and vertical sizes will keep the other respective size constant.\nIf set to a value between 0 and 1 changing the sizes will affect the whole ratio (width and height) and fill the area given in max area (e.g. 0.8 -> 80%).\n"},"reference-docs/editor-configuration/editing-features.html":{"url":"reference-docs/editor-configuration/editing-features.html","title":"Configure editing features","keywords":"","body":"Configuration of editing features\nSome of the editing features visible in the top toolbar when\nyou are editing a document can be configured.\nE.g config/environments/all.js\napp: {\n  useSplitPane: true,\n  useSelectionMode: true,\n  useHistoryMode: true\n}\n\n"},"reference-docs/server-configuration/metadata.html":{"url":"reference-docs/server-configuration/metadata.html","title":"Metadata","keywords":"","body":"Metadata on the Server\nScope\nThis documentation assumes that you have setup a channel and design within Livingdocs.\nYou also know what an environment and a channel config is.\nTo find out more about metadata on the editor you can read the editor documentation or study examples.\nIntroduction\nEvery document(article, page) can have metadata. A metadata object consist of key-value pairs where the key is unique per document.\nA metadata field has a configuration (config + used plugin) and can be configured in the channel config. It's possible to use existing metadata plugins to handle the behavior of the metadata field. It's also possible to create custom plugins.\nExample of a metadata object:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Doctor Who 2\",\n  \"url\": \"/test/doctor-who\",\n  \"seo\": {\n    \"title\": \"BBC TV Show - Doctor Who\",\n    \"description\": \"Best TV show of all times\",\n    \"newsKeywords\": \"tv bbc\",\n    \"excludeFromSpiders\": false\n  }\n}\n\nMetadata can be seen as a public API for a document. Frontends usually access on metadata\nand use them for rendering data(f.e. teasers).\nConfiguration\nA metadata configuration describes the metadata properties. The keys are identical to those of\nthe metadata object. Each channel must provide it's own configuration.\n// Metadata configuration example in the channel config\nmetadata: {\n  title: {\n    plugin: 'li-title',\n    config: {\n      maxLength: 200,\n      required: true\n    }\n  },\n  url: {\n    plugin: 'li-text'\n  },\n  seo: {\n    plugin: 'li-seo'\n  }\n}\n\nPlugin\nA metadata plugin is a set of predefined aspects of a metadata\nproperty. For every property the configuration references a plugin\nto base the configuration on.\nThere is already a set of reusable metadata plugins which are stored in\nplugins/metadata on the livingdocs-server.\nWrite a Custom Plugin\nWhen the behavior of the standard plugins are not enough, you can write custom plugins.\nmodule.exports = {\n  // Plugin name\n  // Use the name as plugin value in the configuration\n  name: 'customername-pluginname',\n\n  // JSON schema\n  // Define the schema of the metadata property\n  schema: {\n    type: 'string'\n  },\n\n  // @param value property value after onPublish has been called.\n  // @param config {Object} config property of `metadata configuration`\n  // @return If you return `false` or even better a `string` with an explanation\n  //   this will be treated as a failed validation.

You can create include components in your design, using an include directive.\nIncludes can render content to your article or page that comes from an external source.\nIncludes are resolved every time a document is rendered. So they can be used to\ndisplay dynamic content that changes after a document has been published.\nDisplaying a teaser for example can be achieved through includes. An article is referenced and its data (eg. title, description, teaser image) is fetched when rendering a page.\nA component with an include directive\nIncludes are directives on components. They can be used as content placeholders\nthat will be filled with HTML created by an include service on the server.\nAn example component, defined in the design, with an include directive:\n\n  {\n    \"name\": \"embed-teaser\",\n    \"label\": \"Article Teaser\",\n    \"directives\": {\n      \"embed-teaser\": {\n        \"service\": \"embed-teaser\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\n\nRendering Options\nIncludes can be resolved in two modes when rendering a document. Either a\n tag can be rendered so the include can be resolved outside of\nlivingdocs (e.g by a script in the browser or a server that delivers the rendered\nhtml to a browser). Or the includes can be resolved on the livingdocs server in\nthe rendering of the document.\nUnresolved include\nAn unresolved include looks like this:\n\n  \n\n\nIt contains all the information needed to replace it with\nthe actual content.\nResolved include\nIf the include is resolved instead of the  you see the actual HTML\nreturned by the include renderer:\n\n  \n    \n    \n        Mathieu Pavageau  on Wed May 25 2016\n      Rocket\n    \n  \n\n\nHow to configure the rendering option\nIncludes are not resolved by default.

The method definition looks as follows:\npublish: ({documentVersion, renditions}, callback)\nUpon every publish event in Livingdocs, e.g., when a user presses the \"Publish\" button in the editor, this hook method is called.\nYou get two parameters that your custom implementation can use: the documentVersion which contains all information about the document and the renditions object which contains all rendered renditions that you defined for your channels. By default the renditions object will contain just one entry webarticle or webpage respectively, which just is the rendered HTML without any alterations. You can define your own renditions with custom output renderers and middlewares (documentation for this will follow).\n\nIf you want to use the HTML of a rendered article, you can access it as renditions.webarticle.html.\nThe documentVersion object\nThe documentVersion object is a core object and thus contains private APIs. You should only use the provided getter methods on the instance in order not to program agains private APIs that are prone to change. The following methods are provided:\n\ngetDocumentId(), returns the unique document id of the document that was published (the same as is in the URL of the editor when you have the document opened)\n\ngetProjectId(), gets the id of the project that this document belongs to\n\ngetSerializedLivingdoc(), gets the document description in the Livingdocs data format (JSON)\n\ngetMetadata(), gets the metadata associated with the document (JSON)\n\ngetDesignDescriptor(), gets the name and version of the design that this document was created with\n\ngetDocumentType(), gets the document type, either 'article' or 'page'\n\nrender(callback), renders the document, i.e., produces output according to your renditions configuration. The hook method is called after a render, so you will probably never want to call render in this context. The callback receives the renditions object.\n\n\nThe unpublish hook\nJust as with the publish hook, you can also configure a method that reacts to unpublish events, e.g. when you need to quickly take an article offline due to copyright infringements. The definition looks as follows:\nunpublish: ({documentVersion}, callback)\nJust as before you get a documentVersion object for the document that was unpublished. If your publish customization notified a third-party system of a new document to present to your readers, you can use this method to take the document from the web again. Be sure to remember the unique document_id in your third-party system so you can reference to your document again.\nSample webhook implementation\nThe boilerplate app implements a very simple webhook module that you can use to send the publish and unpublish payloads to a third-party system via the web. To enable the wehbook module you need to uncomment the feature in the app's configuration as well as in the channel configuration. You will also need to adapt the url endpoints to match the ones of your third-party system.\nThe implementation is extremely bare-bone and only suited to get you started quickly. Please provide your own implementation for production code or at least carefully review the sample code to your requirements.\n"},"reference-docs/server-public-api/routing-system.html":{"url":"reference-docs/server-public-api/routing-system.html","title":"Routing system","keywords":"","body":"Routing System\nUse case\nThe Delivery app is asked to deliver a document located at a path. To resolve a path to a document, the delivery app uses the Routing system endpoint.\n\nDelivery app receives GET /article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8 on the channel web\nDelivery app calls public API of Delivery server: GET https://delivery-server/api/routing/web?path=/article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8\nDelivery server response looks like:\n [{\n   \"type\": \"document\",\n   \"resource\": {\n     \"id\": 173,\n     \"statusCode\": 200\n   }\n }]\n\n\n(Down the road, the delivery app will ask the delivery server for an HTML rendering of the latest publication of this document and serve it to the client)\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe routing system is composed of three parts:\n\nThe routing metadata plugin,\nThe routes indexer, and\nThe routes cache.\n\nRough picture/story of how these components/concepts are tied together:\nThere is a document titled I'm on the road again!, its documentId is 173, it also has a custom publicId 09fed8. It is an article in the project projectId 5, filed in the category adventure.\nThe plugin's responsibility is to generate a path (/article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8) and slugs (i-m-on-the-road-again) for a publication. The user hits 'publish', the routing plugin generates and writes the path and slug to the publication metadata. At the end of the 'publish' call, a publication event is written to the database.\nThe routes indexer sees this new publication event. It first puts the routing information for this publication (found in the publication metadata which the routing metadata plugin wrote) in the routes cache: \"doc:173\" => {path: …, slug: …, …}. The routes indexer, through another intervaled function, puts \"path:5:/article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8\" => {id: 173, resource: {status: 200, …}, …} in the routes cache.\nThe Delivery app gets a GET request for /article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8. It asks the Delivery server; its API does a lookup in the routes cache; this key being in the routes cache it directly returns the corresponding value, which are telling the Delivery app about which document this routes corresponds to, which is here the document 173.\nRouting Metadata Plugin\nTaking a look at our routing metadata plugin example should help you understand how to write your own.\nThis plugin is responsible for generating and writing routing data into a publication metadata. It should also export a function with the following signature documentIdExtractor = (path) => documentId.\nIt is based on the routing info found in each publication metadata that the routes cache will get populated with routes to documents. Therefore the routing metadata plugin hooks into documents onPublish and returns an object {path, slug} which gets written under the key routing in the publication metadata.\nThe documentIdExtractor function will be used in case an exact route match cannot be found. For instance if the cache has /article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8 but the incoming request is for /article/adventure/im-on-the-road-again-09fed8 (notice the typo in the path!), the path will not be found in the routes cache and the routing system endpoint will resort to calling documentIdExtractor('/article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8'), which could for example detect the presence of the public ID 09fed8 and return the corresponding documentId 173. This way the routing system will still be able to respond to the Delivery app, which could in turn redirect its user to the correct path for this resource, /article/adventure/i-m-on-the-road-again-09fed8.\nRoutes Indexer\nThe routes indexer is a procedure running at a configurable interval. It runs at most once per interval duration (i.e. if one iteration takes longer than the interval, the next iteration will only start as soon as the previous one is done, they cannot overlap).\nThe routes indexer watches the publication events, polling the database for events that happened after the last indexed event, lastIndexedEvent being a special key-value in the routes cache.\nStart up, warm up\nWhen the server starts, if the routes cache is empty, the interval will be set to zero and the server will index all existing publication events as fast as it can.\nSince the routes cache has lastIndexedEvent key, if the server reboots and the routes cache backend in use is persisted somewhere, the routes indexer will pick up where it left off instead of reindexing everything from the beginning.\nRoutes Cache\nThe routes cache is a key-value store interfaced using a leveldb API provided by levelup. It can be backed by any compatible engine. A few options include:\n\nmemdown, an in-memory KV store - we use it in our tests since we don't care about persisting the cache\nredisdown, which is a Redis backend - not recommended because untested yet, might create issues if you have several indexers running concurrently\n\nThe routes cache has two keys per once-published document (i.e. not per publication but rather per document for which we got at least one publication event).\n\nA key associating a document id (keyed as doc:) to some metadata about the corresponding document, most importantly its state (published, unpublished) and the metadata routing data, and\nA key associating a path (keyed as path::) to roughly an API response.\n\nConfiguration\nRouting configuration takes place on two levels:\n\nEnvironment - globally configure and enable the routing, and\nPer document type per channel - enable routing for each document type for each channel you'd like to route to.\n\nEnvironment\nIn your environment configuration file (here, local.coffee), a top-level config key named routing is required, with the following possible keys:\n  routing:\n    enabled: false\n    db: 'redisdown' # (default: memdown)\n    # db_options: # (optional) cf. https://github.com/Level/levelup#options\n    redis: # (optional)\n      master_check_interval: 5000 # (default: 5000) how often do we check if we're the master\n    indexing: # (optional)\n      # number of publication events to process in each batch\n      batch_size: 50000 # (default: 50000)\n      # routes cache update interval\n      watch_interval: 1000 # (default: 1000)\n\nIf not explicitly set to enabled: true, routing will be disabled.\nMaster check\nIn a setting with more than one Delivery server running against the same routes cache, we want to have at most one routes indexer running at any time. Having many of them trying to concurrently index the same publication events could create issues.\nWhen using Redis, a Delivery server will either be the master and index the routes by running the routes indexer or not be the master and not index the routes by pausing the routes indexer.\nWhen a master crashes or gets shut down, another node will get promoted master. Same goes when master gets too slow because of the load or any other issue: it will get demoted and another node will get promoted.\nrouting:redis:master_check_interval is the interval at which a process checks whether they are master or not, and should or should not get demoted or promoted.\nDocument types per channel\nMetadata plugins are configured per document type per channel. If you would like to route to articles and pages in the channel web, you will have to set the following keys in the following files:\n\nconf/channels/web/articles.coffee:\n  metadata:\n    routing:\n      plugin: 'li-default-routing'\n\n\nconf/channels/web/pages.coffee:\n  metadata:\n    routing:\n      plugin: 'li-default-routing'\n\n\n\nRoutes/path customization\nCustomizing the path generated for each publication is done via the routing metadata plugin.\nGenerating routing info for existing publications\nAny document published prior to configuring the routing metadata plugin for their document type in their channel will not possess any metadata routing info, therefore the indexer will not be able to take them into account.\nIf you already have published documents but their metadata don't have routing infos because the plugin wasn't there when they were published, the easiest fix is to republish these documents. No need to delete them and recreate them, republishing is enough to get the metadata up to date.\n"},"concepts/metadata/metadata-examples.html":{"url":"concepts/metadata/metadata-examples.html","title":"Metadata Example (editor and server)","keywords":"","body":"Example 1: Full Example on how to Introduce a Metadata Field with a Standard Metadata Plugin\nSay we want to create a new metadata field \"catchline\" for articles of your default web channel.

In our example we use li-text.\nOpen the respective configuration file, in our case conf/channels/web/article/all.coffee and add the catchline config from the example to the metadata object into all.coffee.\nOpen your elastic search metadata mapping (typically in search/custom-mappings/metadata.json) and add an entry as follows (the key properties probably already exists):{\n\"properties\": {\n \"catchline\": {\n   \"type\": \"string\"\n }\n}\n}\n\n\nReset your document elastic search index by running grunt search-index:document:reset\n\nEditor\nAfter you've setup your new metadata field you can now use it in the editor.

It only describes the API endpoints that you have to implement in order to use your print system with the Livingdocs editor.\nConcepts\nLivingdocs itself knows nothing about a print layouting system. All it does is rendering information it gets back. In order to do this, Livingdocs sends out requests to a number of defined endpoints and expects results in a certain format. Currently, the data format is in XML which was basically driven by need. If you'd rather have JSON, please get in contact with us, we'd love to do this.\nMost likely you will implement a middleware in between Livingdocs and your print system that takes the requests from Livingdocs and transforms them to requests of your print system, delivering back the relevant information.\nTo sum up:\n\nLivingdocs sends the requests. Your integration needs to respond to those. You never need to send a request to Livingdocs on your own initiative.\nThe data format is (currently) XML\nYou need to provide Livingdocs with the relevant print information otherwise Livingdocs can not perform a reliable job informing about the layouting system\n\nEditor config\nSettings for the editor are located under print:\ndefaultPreviewMode: determines default preview mode, valid values are text or image, if not configured falls back to text\nThe endpoints\nAll Livingdocs requests require you to have configured endpoints on your side where your middleware sits. The respective entry in the Livingdocs configuration looks as follows:\nprint:\n  enabled: true\n  host: 'https://your-host.com'\n  xmlRoot: 'pathUnderWhichTheEndpointsLive'\n\nIn the example above we would send each of the following requests to https://your-host.com/pathUnderWhichTheEndpointsLive/\nThe subsequent subchapters look at each of the possible requests.\nLayouts\nBefore a print document is created and whenever a user wants to change the layout of an existing print article, Livingdocs will ask you for the list of available layouts. Layouts assume a layout-for-text workflow. Thus they are the placed and sized boxes in your InDesign file for a specific publication of your newspaper. Journalists are expected to fit their text into those layouts.\nLivingdocs sends the following request to get the layouts.\nTo:\nPOST /support\n\nPayload:\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nAs you can see there are basically 2 parts: an authentication and the layout request.\nThe authentication sends you a username and a password that you can use to authenticate Livingdocs with your middleware. You can currently only configure one user for all requests.\nThe layout part queries for the requested publication and the date of this publication (e.g. tomorrow's newspaper). The date will be in the format \"dd.mm.YYYY\", e.g. \"02.09.2016\".\nYour response should look as follows:\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nEach line represents one layout, i.e., one placed and sized box in the InDesign file. The information you need to provide are:\n\ndepartment, the organisational department of the newspaper, e.g. 'International'\ngroup, namespacing in your layout\nid, a unique id with which you can access the layout, Livingdocs will store this and send it to the middleware in subsequent requests\ncolumns, the number of columns that this layout has\nname, the name of this layout, will be displayed in the Livingdocs layout search (see screenshot below)\npage, the page of your newspaper where this layout is placed\nstatus, one of the supported statuses\npublication, the publication to which this layout belongs\npublicationDate, the date of the publication for which the layout was requested\n\n\nThe screenshot above shows how to choose a print layout in the Livingdocs user interface\nTemplates\nTemplates are basically the same as layouts, except that they are for text-for-layout workflows. Templates are pre-defined boxes that are not yet placed on any publication or edition but are common blueprints, e.g. a one-column text. Livingdocs sends the following request to get the templates.\nTo:\nPOST /support\n\nPayload:\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nAgain, we are using an authentication block. The second block defines the publication name for which you want to get the templates. Note that you don't get a specific publication date since templates are independent of any specific edition. The allowedOnCms parameter will always be true for calls from Livingdocs.\nYour response should look as follows:\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nEach line represents one template, i.e., one generic box that can be used in InDesign. The information you need to provide are:\n\ndepartment, the organisational department of the newspaper, e.g. 'International'\ncolumns, the number of columns that this template has\ngroup, namespacing in your template\nid, a unique id with which you can access the template, LD will send you this later on\nname, the name of this template, will be displayed in the LD Layout search\npublication, the publication to which this template belongs\n\n\nThe screenshot above shows how to choose a print template in the Livingdocs user interface\nPublication Dates\nPublication Dates are used for the layouts. They return the dates for which, in a certain publication, layouts already exist, i.e. an InDesign file was prepared for the edition. Livingdocs sends the following request to get the available publication dates (editions):\nTo:\nPOST /support\n\nPayload:\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThe authentication block is equivalent to the other requests. The second block defines for which publication you want to get the prepared edition dates and in which time frame (in the example between the 3rd and 23rd of September).\nYour response should look as follows:\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n         \n         \n      \n   \n\n\nEach line represents one prepared edition's date. The information you need to provide are:\n\ndate, the date for which this edition is prepared\npublication, the publication to which the prepared edition belongs\nisToday, a boolean indicating the current edition, NOTE: the current edition is normally tomorrow's newspaper\n\nPreview\nThis is really the gist of the Livingdocs Print API. In the preview response your middleware tells Livingdocs how a specific block of text is rendered in your print system's layout so that Livingdocs can give the journalists the respective information in the editor.\nLivingdocs will call your middleware with the following request.\nTo:\n/getPreview\n\nPayload:\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            Heiligsprechung von Mutter Teresa\n            Die Makellosigkeit der Heiligen\n            Gabriel Hase\n            Mutter Teresa hat für ihren Dienst an den Ärmsten viel Respekt erhalten.

Der abgemagerte Mann antwortet nicht, wenn das Wort an ihn gerichtet wird, sondern zieht nur die raue Wolldecke noch etwas höher über den Kopf. Unbeeindruckt vom Elend steht direkt daneben eine Hochzeitsgesellschaft. Die reich mit Gold geschmückte Braut wartet mit Freundinnen auf die Ankunft ihres Zukünftigen, der bald vom nahen Tempel der Göttin Kali zurückkehren wird. Drinnen im Hospiz, hinter der schweren Holztüre, liegen Kranke und Sterbende auf einfachen Feldbetten. Nonnen im grauen Gewand und einige westlich gekleidete Freiwillige kümmern sich um die vielleicht 50 ärmlichen Gestalten. Es herrscht eine nüchterne Atmosphäre, die Einrichtung ist spartanisch einfach. Falls Jahrzehnte einen Geruch haben, dann riecht es nach den fünfziger Jahren.\n        \n    \n\n\nThe authentication block is equivalent to the other requests. The getPreview block first defines the layout or template id for which a preview is requested (NOTE: you previously sent this to Livingdocs in the template or layout response, see above) and the type of preview that is requested. The type can be:\n\narticleJpeg, gets the preview in text and image form (both)\narticleText, gets only the textual preview\npageJpeg, gets the preview for the whole page (Seite) in which this template is placed, both textual and image\npageText, gets the preview for the whole page (Seite) in which this template is placed, only textual\n\nInside the getPreview block, Livingdocs sends you an article block. This block defines parts of the article content. Each content element has a type attribute and in its content, the actual text that the journalist wrote. The types can be configured/extended with your print design (a Livingdocs design specific for print). We provide a standard print design out of the box with the following types:\n\nheadline\ncatchline\nsubtitle\nlead\nbyline\nparagraph\nsubhead\nfootnote\n\nYour middleware is now responsible to use the provided data, feed it to your print layouting system and calculate:\n\nthe correct linebreaks\nthe over-and underflow\ncheck if the provided content types are correct for the chosen layout (or template)\n\nYour response to Livingdocs should look as follows:\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n            Die Makellosigkeit der Heiligen\n         \n         \n            Auf der Eingangstreppe zum Hospiz \n            liegt eine zitternde Gestalt.

The content blocks define logical components of your layout or templates in InDesign, such as the title or the body text. The rows define the textual content represented in rows. Each row defines:\n\nid, identifies the rows within a content block, normally just a counter\ndebug, the name of the component in your InDesign layout\njustifying, the justification information, can be left or justify\nnumber, the row number in the overall layout or template (Zeilennummer), displayed on the left of the Livingdocs preview\ntype, 'title' or 'text'\ncolumn, the column in which the row is rendered\n\nIf the content contained information that is not present in the layout or template you can notify Livingdocs of this. For example, if Livingdocs sent you an author content element, but the respective layout in InDesign has no match for author, then you can send back a row containing text that matches the following regex:\n/IM CMS ZUSATZTEXT FÜR (\\w+): (.*)/\n\nIf Livingdocs sees this regex in a row it will render a respective message in the print preview. All of those messages should come at the end of the content block.\n\nThe preview indicating that the component \"Untertitel\" is not present in this layout\nIn addition, if a jpeg preview was requested, you need to send a previews block that passes the URL to an image with the jpeg preview.\n\nThe screenshot above shows the Livingdocs print preview. To the right the journalist writes text in Livingdocs (the request) and to the left the preview from the print system is displayed (your response)\nMetadata - department\nBefore exporting a print article to the print system, the journalist will add some metadata.

The first is general, document-related metadata. It contains:\n\ninformation about the author, in particular:\nthe full name\nfields that indicate the royalty\n\n\ninformation about the print article, in particular:\nlivingdocsId, the Livingdocs ID (you need to store this for later referencing)\nname, the name (title) of the article\npublication, the publication in which this article is exported (published)\npublicationDate, the date (edition) for which this article is exported\ndepartment, the department in which this article is exported\ntemplateId or layoutId, the id of the InDesign template or layout for which this article was written\nstatus, the status of this article, see available statuses\n\n\n\nThe second (livingdocsMetadata) metadata block contains information that is specific to Livingdocs:\n\nchannel, the name of the Livingdocs channel where this article derives from\ncreatedAt, the timestamp when this article was created\nupdatedAt, the timestamp when this article was last update\nenvironment, the environment from which the export call derives, useful for local debugging\n\nThe main content is in the articleExportData block. It contains the content in components of the Livingdocs print design, e.g. the title and the text.\nAside of the component-based export, there is also an html field where the whole document is rendered as HTML.\nYour middleware should use all of this information to export the article to the print system. You will not need to send anything back to Livingdocs except for the status of the export (success or failure).\nResponse:\n\n\n   \n\n\nLifecycle - Status\nThe status call bears a lot of importance. When a print article has been written or partly written its status in the print system may update. For example the article might be locked in the print system or it might have gone to the printing press. To know about such status changes, Livingdocs polls your middleware for status updates. Currently, Livingdocs will call status for the following actions:\n\nwhen a preview is requested, i.e. whenever a user changes something in the text\nbefore the user exports the article\n\nLivingdocs will send the following request.\nTo:\n/status\n\nPayload:\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\nThe authentication block is equivalent to the other requests. The getStatus block basically only contains the livingdocsId. Your middleware should have saved this when the article was first exported and should be able to match it against the value you get here.\nYour middleware's response should look as follows.\nResponse:\n\n\n   \n\n\nThe getStatus elements contains the following attributes:\n\nisEditable, tells Livingdocs if this article can still be edited or is locked (it will switch the editor to read-only if you set this field to false)\nlayoutId, the id of the layout where this article is placed. If the layout id changes in the print system you can set the changed layoutId here and Livingdocs will adapt accordingly\nlivingdocsId, the Livingdocs id, should match what you got in the request\nstatusName, the print status this article is in, see the available statuses below\n\nAvailable statuses\nThe available statuses values for a print article are:\n\nRedigieren, the article is being edited\nGegenlesen, the article is being proofread\nUmbruch, the article is in preparation for layouting, it is read-only for the editor\nKorrekturlesen, the article is being corrected\nKorrigiert, the article has been corrected\nPlaciert, the article has been placed in the editon's InDesign file\nFreigabe, the article is ready for the printing press\nPapierkorb, the article is being deleted (archived)\n\nNOTE: Currently, all of these statuses are informational, i.e. Livingdocs does not evaluate them.

This API is mostly used to create content-delivery apps, e.g., a start page of an online magazine.\nAn editing API that requires authentication and can be used to modify documents. This API is also used by the livingdocs editor.\n\nThis Documentation is split into three parts: Describing the public API, describing the editing API, and in a third section, describing the underlying API concepts you need in order to extend the API.\nPublic API\nThe public API is read-only. It allows you to get the content that you could otherwise also get with a browser when looking at the public content on livingdocs. Responses are sent with jsonp. There is no authentication required at this moment, access is free and unlimited.\nThe public API is used to create delivery apps for your content, e.g., a blogging app, or a magazine start page.\nThe following pages will help you to start working with the public API:\n\nAvailable Endpoints\nErrors returned by the API\n\nExample applications:\n\nSample implementation - Node.JS Blog\nSample implementation - Meteor.JS real-time/mobile\n\nWebhooks (Hooks)\nWebhooks are an alternative to polling changes using the Public API. You can subscribe a URL with the livingdocs Hooks API that will get notified with a respective update. This is also great to build real-time applications where you want to render updates automatically instead of only after a refresh.\n\nAvailable Webhooks\n\nEditing API\nThe editing API is read/write and requires authentication. You can only modify and get documents through the editing API that you own or are associated with through a space (shared account).\nThe editing API is used mainly for two motivations: to write your own editor (analogous to the livingdocs editor) or to do a third-party integration, e.g., with some publishing CMS.\nThe following pages will help you to start working with the editing API:\n\nAvailable Endpoints\nAuthentication\nErrors returned by the API\nLivingdocs Editor as a sample editor implementation\n\nExtending the API\nEspecially, when developing your own editor you might get to a point where you need to extend the livingdocs API. The following pages give you a first glimpse into the concepts used to build the livingdocs API and how you can use them for yourself. Most of your work will though still be in the code of the livingdocs api as only sparse documentation exists.\n\nAPI Basics\nCORS\n\n"},"reference-docs/maintenance/release-management/":{"url":"reference-docs/maintenance/release-management/","title":"Releases","keywords":"","body":"Release Management\nThis section describes how a livingdocs-service is handled regarding processes and tools.\n\nDeployment Pipeline Architecture\nHow to Handle a Downstream Release on Develop\nHow to Handle a Downstream Release on Staging\nHow to Handle a Downstream Release on Production\n\nHow to Handle a Downstream Release on Develop\n\nEverything is automated, you have to do nothing.

A basic Amazon S3 instance or a simple nginx installation should be sufficient. CPU, memory and disk requirements are low. Even with a large number of people working in the editor, you should not hit limitations quickly. \nServer\nThe servers CPU requirements compares to the ones of a regular node application. One process requires about 250MB memory. Disk is not an issue since the application footprint is low and uploaded assets are stored in the cloud. You can expect to hit limitations earlier in the server than in the editor. This of depends on the number of users and the tasks they and developers perform. \n If you expect a lot of traffic on the assets, it might be worth to put a CDN in front of resrc.it.\nDatabases\nThe requirements for the databases of course depend on the amount of data you want to store. Also on the interactions with the database through users and developers. Depending on your requirements, you might want to think about replication. \nPostgresql\nThe database requirements are comparable to any other postgres installation. There is an extensive guide on postgres hardware optimized for high performance.   \nElasticsearch\nElasticsearch is more memory hungry than the rest of the stack. It should mostly be light on CPU though. Elasticsearch provides a good guide on the hardware requirements. \nServices\nCloud storage\nThe storage your installation needs is directly coupled to the documents you upload and store. Cloud storage is easily scalable, so you should not expect any troubles here.\nReal life examples\nBelow you can find an overview of real life installations. \nMinimum requirements\nWe are running Livingdocs on very basic Amazon S3, Heroku and Cloudfoundry instances for demo, staging and development installations.

The content is made accessible to the delivery stack.\nDelivery stack: Services allowing the end user to read the content on the website or mobile application.\n\nApplications\n\nEditor: A single page application serving the editors web interface. It consists of static assets only. This is where the editorial user logs in and writes content.\nServer: A node.js application. It can be started in two different modes: \nIn editing mode, it acts as the backend for the li-editor, storing content, handling file uploads, cropping, authentication and so on. It does expose a REST API for the li-editor to connect to.\nIn delivery mode, the purpose of it is to provide a REST API for the delivery to present the content to the user\n\n\nDelivery: A node.js application. Makes content written in livingdocs is available to end users. Its primary purpose is to render a website.\n\nServices\n\nPostgres (PG): Primary data store for the server. For example pages, articles, menus, users are persisted here.
