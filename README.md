# Livingdocs documentation

Livingdocs is not only a CMS but a component-based solution to publish across many devices and products.

This technical documentation is split up in the following main parts:
* **Concepts:** The high level concepts and philosophy behind Livingdocs
* **Contribution guidelines:** Describes how we collaborate and contains details on best practices we follow
* **Public:** Public documentation helping you to get started with Livingdocs
* **Core:** More detailed documentation on the internals of Livingdocs, that you likely only will need if you're contributing to the core
