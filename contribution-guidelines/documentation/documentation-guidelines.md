# Documentation guidelines

## Where to document?
 
All documentation goes into the central documentation repository: https://github.com/upfrontIO/livingdocs

Resist to put documentation anywhere else than here.  

### Exceptions

#### API documentation

An exception to the central repository, concerns the documentation of the public API which is included in the editor https://github.com/upfrontIO/livingdocs-editor/tree/master/documentation

#### READMEs

READMEs are totally fine, but please keep the scope limited and prefer to document in the central documentation repository. Check out the [README guidelines](./how-to-write-readmes.md)

 
## Prevent duplication 
 
Keeping documentation up to date is tedious enough if it's found in one predictable place.
It's a nightmare if it has to be updated in multiple places. 
  
Please be extra mindful about not duplicating documentation (between up/downstreams, READMEs and central documentation, within the central documentation itself, etc.)
