## Livingdocs Concepts
Concepts describe the fundamental concepts of Livingdocs. They help you understand how we at Livingdocs think about the software. You will also learn the right words to describe specific things.


Examples:
What is a Livingdoc?
What is a document/page, a component, a no-CMS…?

## Public documentation
**Audience: service customers**

In the public documentation we cover everything you need to know for using a custom Livingdocs instance.

The public documentation is organized around Topics. A topic is a walkthrough of one of Livingdocs customer-oriented feature.

Topics:
- Design Setup & Configuration
- The server’s public/document REST API
- The server’s configuration options
- Core API to extend the server with custom code

## Core documentation
**Audience: integration customers, core-developers/designers**

Detailed inventory of APIs, configurations, tools and operations available for each core project: server, editor and framework. It is the internal/private documentation. It should not overlap with the public documentation, but together, they hold a complete documentation of the Livingdocs codebase.

The guides contain a set of step by step instructions that cover day to day use cases. Guides act as the mortar/glue between the projects and often describe cross-repository tasks.


### Guides:
- Setup a working environment

### Architecture:
- How do server, editor and framework play together?
- How does authentication work?

### APIs:
- Server: Editing API
- Server: Document Entities Manager
- Server: Core API to extend the editor with custom code

## Contribution Guidelines

A collection of guides we follow in our daily work. This describes coding styles and practices for the programming languages that we use. Also guidelines of our collaborative workflows.

# Readmes
Located in the individual project repository


In the readme we find a limited set of instructions and a couple of links to the central documentation. It is the cheat sheet for the repository.



A 3rd type of documentation could be Q&A. We could use a Stackoverflow.
