## Getting Started

How you get started depends on your use case.

## Livingdocs as a service

You can use our hosted Livingdocs at [beta.livingdocs.io](http://beta.livingdocs.io) and do your integration using our API. This is a headless CMS approach. You can get started immediately by just creating an account on livingdocs.io
Refer to our [API documentation](https://beta.livingdocs.io/public-api.html#/public-api.html) for more information on the available endpoints.

## Livingdocs on-premises

If you use Livingdocs as an on-premises software you will have access to the (private) boilerplates projects and/or an .npmrc file with access to our core repositories (Note: this requires at least signing an evaluation contract, if you haven't done so already contact us at contact@livingdocs.io).
To get a local setup refer to [our setup guide](walkthroughs/getting-started-with-local-development.md) and the README's linked in the boilerplate projects.
To get a devops environment, refer to our [devops section](setup-and-deployment/self-hosting.md).
